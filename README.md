simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
2. One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
3. If person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
4. If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby
seats are booked.
5. User can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full. 6. You donâ€™t have to create login
